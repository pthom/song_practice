The intent of this project is to provide a tool for singers to practice singing over pre-recorded tracks. The pre-recorded tracks will come under the form of an audio file (mp3, wav, etc.).
The tool will allow users to load an audio file and play it back while providing the following features :

- Displaying the audio waveform for visual reference, with a cursor indicating the current playback position, and allowing users to drag the cursor on the waveform to jump to specific points in the track.
- Providing basic playback controls : play, pause, stop, rewind, fast-forward, seek, advance by small increments (1, 5, 10 seconds).
- Allowing users to set loop points (or starting points) to repeat specific sections of the track for focused practice.
- Enabling users to adjust the playback speed without changing the pitch, to practice difficult sections at a manageable tempo.
- Optional: Enabling users to adjust the pitch of the track to match their vocal range.
- Optional: Providing a simple metronome feature to help singers keep time with the music.
- Enabling users to save and load their practice settings (loop points, playback speed, pitch adjustments) for future sessions.


The tool will be developed as a desktop application using a cross-platform framework to ensure compatibility with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux). Options for future expansion could include mobile app versions or web-based implementations.
The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, catering to both novice and experienced singers. The project will leverage existing audio processing libraries to handle audio playback, waveform visualization, and pitch/speed adjustments efficiently.
